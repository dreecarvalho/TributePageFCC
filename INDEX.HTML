        <p> The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the predecessor of the computers part of our lives today. </p>
        <p> Used during World War II to calculate artillery trajectories, it was around 2,400 times faster than a human at calculating a trajectory.</p>
        <p> Its configuration like a collection of electronic adding machines controlled by a web of electrical cables. It was programmed by plugboard wiring and three “portable function tables” for entering tables of numbers. This was done by setting 1,200 10-way switches on each portable function table.</p>
        <p> This work was given to a team of six women:</p>
      
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bartik" target="_blank">Jean Jennings</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlyn_Meltzer" target="_blank">Marlyn Wescoff</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Teitelbaum" target="_blank">Ruth Lichterman</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Holberton" target="_blank">Betty Snyder</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Spence" target="_blank">Frances Bilas</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Antonelli" target="_blank">Kay McNulty</a></li>
             </ul>  
      
        <p> Women were previously hired to calculate artillery trajectories by hand. These six women were selected out of a group of “computers” to work on a top-secret project. </p>
        <p> The programming process required analyzing differential equations, determining how to patch the cables to connect to the correct electronic circuits and setting the thousands of 10-way switches. The women physically hand-wired the machine, an arduous task using switches, cables, and digit trays to route data and program pulses.</p>
        <p> The original programers of the ENIAC were neither recognized for their efforts, nor known to the public until the mid-1980s.</p>
        <p> The story of these ENIAC programmers working together is the synthesis of women from different backgrounds working together and solving problems despite (or because of) their differences—appreciating and respecting a broad range of perspectives and growing together technically and socially.</p>
        <p> They are definitely inspiring models to us, women learning how to code and how to create solutions that will make difference to everyone's lives.</p>
